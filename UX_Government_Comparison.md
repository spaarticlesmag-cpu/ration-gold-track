# Government UX Comparison and Recommendations

This study analyzes common design and interaction patterns across Indian government digital services and applies them to strengthen the JADAYU experience for both mobile and desktop users.

## Sources Observed
- Public Distribution System (PDS) portals for multiple states (layout norms, information hierarchy)
- National e-Governance Service Delivery (UI norms: clear typography, breadcrumbing, status banners)
- UMANG and DigiLocker apps (mobile-first navigation patterns, offline-friendly cues)
- Aadhaar related flows (KUA/verification UX cues: progress steps, consent text, information density)

## Key Patterns
1. Conservative color usage with strong contrast and large tap targets
2. Always-visible page title and context, with breadcrumbs where multi-level
3. Step-by-step verification flows with explicit status and retry guidance
4. Dense data presented using cards or tables with clear labels and left-aligned values
5. Important actions grouped at the top or bottom as sticky bars for mobile
6. Extensive use of plain-language labels and bilingual readiness

## Gaps Noted in Current App
- Information density is sometimes too high on mobile, causing layout jumps
- Controls cluster horizontally; should wrap or stack on small screens
- Navigation home context was ambiguous; now standardized to `/app`
- Card details preceded hero inconsistently; now moved beneath hero for clarity

## Recommendations Implemented
- Mobile-first adjustments in admin orders and dashboard: wrapping actions, scrollable tabs, `min-h-[100svh]`
- Customer flow: hero and navigation positioned first; card details follow
- Public landing page added for pre-auth onboarding and SEO
- Brand/home links normalized to `/app` for authenticated users

## Future Enhancements
- Add breadcrumb on admin subsections and delivery flows
- Introduce bilingual labels framework (en-IN + local language)
- Provide accessibility audit (contrast, ARIA on interactive controls)
- Add sticky footer action bar for long forms on mobile
- Add progressive disclosure for long addresses and notes (expand/collapse)
