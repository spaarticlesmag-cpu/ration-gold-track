# Deployment Guide

## Vercel Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel with the following setup:

### Build Configuration
- **Framework**: Vite + React
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: 18

### Environment Variables
The application uses Supabase for backend services. The following environment variables are already configured in the code:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: https://bqyfsngkqkphsdqklfge.supabase.co
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Configured in client.ts

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the main branch
2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**: Vercel will automatically detect changes and deploy
3. **Manual Deploy**: If needed, trigger deployment from Vercel dashboard

### Build Optimization

The current build generates a large JavaScript bundle (~864KB). For production optimization, consider:

1. **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for route-based splitting
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Use `npm run build -- --analyze` to identify large dependencies
3. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused code is eliminated

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Review the build output in Vercel dashboard
2. **Local Build Test**: Run `npm run build` locally to identify issues
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. **Environment Variables**: Verify all required environment variables are set

### Current Status
✅ Build is working successfully
✅ All critical linting errors fixed
✅ Vercel configuration optimized
✅ Supabase integration configured

### Performance Notes
- Bundle size warning is normal for a feature-rich React app
- Consider implementing lazy loading for better performance
- Images are optimized and compressed
